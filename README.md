# Bill the Bootstrap Mill

<img src="/readme_images/Mill_Only.png" width="800">


The Bootstrap Mill is designed to be created from forms that can be cut on a PrintNC or similar router.  It uses commodity Ultra-High-Performance-Concrete (UHPC) or similar mixes to create the main forms of the machine frame.  Precision surfaces are meant to be optimized using epoxy transfer method and features are built into the frame to facilitate this more easily.  Table is 400x300mm with around 150mm of z clearance, and there is some over-travel so the spindle can reach all the way around the outside.  The box section off the the side is so that the spindle can travel over to access an ATC changer, and it also serves as a moutning point for the X motor to keep the frame mold as simple as possible.  The frame is abidextrous so the toolchanger could be mounted on either side with minimal modifications.

While the main CAD is drawn from scratch, the design obviously derives inpiration from the excellent frames and machines that are produced by https://www.cnc-technik-mueller.de/ as well as by other UHPC projects that have been posted across various websites.  By posting detailed CAD for both the machine and the molds it is our hope to create a project that anyone can reproduce, even if they are in a remote rural area without access to large machine tools that are commonly used to create the precision faces for frames like this.
